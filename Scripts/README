### Step 1

Vcf2Ped.py converts Vcf to "Ped like" files that can process upto three alternate alleles in Vcf files.

Vcf2Ped_cmd.sh can be used directly in bash to process all the files in a folder.


### Step 2

Given vcf and ped files (generated from step 1) Ped2Hap.R generates the haplotypes counts from 26 populations of 1000 Genomes 
for each haplotype. Minimum haplotype count is 4 Haplotypes.
